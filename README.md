# Ecommerce-Fraud-Detection
This project analyzes an e-commerce transaction dataset to understand how transaction behavior and payment security checks together predict fraud risk. The goal is to help businesses reduce fraud losses while minimizing false declines by applying risk-based security controls instead of blanket verification.
